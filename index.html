            <h2>My Hometown</h2>
            <p>Caraguatatuba, widely known by its abbreviation Caraguá,<br>
                 is a city in the eastern part of the southern state of São Paulo in Brazil.<br>
                  It is part of the Metropolitan Region of Vale do Paraíba e Litoral Norte.<br>
                   The population is 123,389 in an area of 485.10 km².</p>
            
            <h2>My Majors And Plans After Graduation</h2>
            <p>In 2019 I started studying Music at the University of the Cumberlands.<br>
               When the pandemics hit and lots of people lost their jobs, I thought it would be<br>
            good to have an option in the future in case I (like many people) would not be able to go<br>
            outside to work. By then I had had some contact with coding and decide to pursue a degree in<br>
            information technology. After my graduation I'll work as a software developer.</p>
            
            <h2>My Relationship with the Internet</h2>
            <p>I use the internet for most of the things I do daily.<br>
                When wanting to talk to my family, I use the internet.<br>
                When wanting to watch a movie or TV show, I use the internet<br>
                To complete most of my school assignment, I use the internet.<br>
                So, although sometimes I don't like to admit, I rely on the internet<br>
                to do most of the things I need to do daily. Which makes me spend<br> 
                a lot of online.</p>
